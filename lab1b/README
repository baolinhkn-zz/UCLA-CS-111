I consulted the following sites when creating my program,

While working on this project, I ran into several issues.
The sanity check failed during the trivial case, noting that I was not properly executing
shell commands, despite my program working correctly when I simply ran it by hand. I spent
some time trying to resolve this issue before deciding to start over. This time, as I
wrote my program, I was extra meticulous. During this time, the server was down so I had
to run the sanity check on my own machine. I resolved this issue with the sanity check
outright failing. However, later, I ran the sanity check again and this time, it hung.

To solve the issue of hanging, I redownloaded the P1B_check.sh file. Turns out, I had
modified the P1B_check.sh file in order to try and fix my prevoius error and as a result, it
caused hanging on my new version of the project. Once redownloaded, that problem was fixed.
